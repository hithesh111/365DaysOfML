# 365DaysOfML
A commitment to learn ML (and related topics) every day for 365 days starting Jan 1 2023.

## References
1. The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESLR)

#### Day 1: ESLR 2.1 to 2.3 

Introduction to Supervised Learning, Variable Types, Encodings, Two Simple Approaches to Prediction: Least Squares and Nearest Neighbors, Other Models as a variant of these two approaches

#### Day 2: ESLR 2.4

Statistical Decision Theory: Probabilistic Setup, Conditional Mean/Median as Regression Function for Squared Loss/Absolute Loss, Linear Model Estimates and Nearest Neighbor Model Estimates from the Regression Function, Solution for Categorical Target Variable, Bayes Classifier.

#### Day 3: ESLR 2.5

Local Methods in High Dimensions: Curse of dimensionality, Nearest Neighbours not really "Near" in Nearest Neighbor models in High Dimensions, Bias-Variance Decomposition of MSE, Linear Assumption (and other Rigid Assumptions) to avoid Curse of Dimensionality.
